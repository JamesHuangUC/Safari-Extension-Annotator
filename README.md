This extension is based on the [Annotator.js library](http://annotatorjs.org) and [Offline Annotator Plugin](https://github.com/aron/annotator.offline.js). User can highlight, annotate any text on the webpage. User can view and edit previous annotation. Also, when user reloads the page, any highlighting text or annotations will still be there! Of course, user can toggle their to see the highlighting text or annotations on or off.
